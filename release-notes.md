# Codebase 2 v 1.1.2 Release Notes
We're looking at a few minor patches and bug fixes in this release that have been a long time coming!
The dev team would like to thank everyone that helped us move this along, and give ourselves a pat on
the back as well. We're testing out the waters with this release, but there will be a major release
within the next month that will implement a new gallery that will give our clients a more modern,
responsive experience. More on that in the next release notes though, for now let's talk about changes
to this one:
## Bug Fixes
### Carousel-3 Module
**Problem** - When there is no title on this module, there is no space between the content and the top
of the module.<br>
**Solution** - We created a spacer that can be added to any HTML element. When there's no title, the
spacer appears and makes sure the module looks correct.
### Static Image Content Module ###
**Problem** - When using paragraph tags in the text editor, if you switch between "Text" and "Visual",
the tags disappear.<br>
**Solution** - There's a lightweight plugin called Advanced Editor Tools, which is now in our suite of
plugins on every site moving forward.
## New Features & Site Enhancements ##
### Parent Theme Styling ###
We've been looking to update our parent theme for a while, and that moment is here! One of the big ways
we're improving the site will be with modern styling, using a language called SCSS. Without going into
the technical details, we'll be using code that is more responsive and performant, and we're working
closely with Luis to make sure that any new code we add to the parent theme from now on will be optimized
for SEO. To that end, we've cleaned up all the telephone links, social media links and images to make
Google happy with us!

That's it for this release, we'll be releasing a new minor version within the month, and many more new
releases in the future.
